      <p>Sadness, feeling down, and having a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities are familiar feelings for all of us. But if they persist and affect our lives substantially, the issue may be depression.Depression is a mood disorder that involves a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.</p><p> It is different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life.Major life events, such as bereavement or the loss of a job, can lead to depression. However, doctors only consider feelings of grief to be part of depression if they persist.Depression is an ongoing problem, not a passing one. It consists of episodes during which the symptoms last for at least 2 weeks. Depression can last for several weeks, months, or years.</p>

      <p>The medical community does not fully understand the causes of depression. There are many possible causes, and sometimes, various factors combine to trigger symptoms.</p><p>Factors that are likely to play a role include:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>genetic features</li>
        <li>changes in the brain’s neurotransmitter levels</li>
        <li>environmental factors</li>
        <li>psychological and social factors</li>
        <li>additional conditions, such as bipolar disorder</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Treatment">

      <ul>
<li>Support: This can range from discussing practical solutions and possible causes to educating family members.</li>

<li>Psychotherapy: Also known as talking therapy, some options include one-to-one counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</li>

        <li>Drug treatment: A doctor may prescribe antidepressants.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are several forms of depression. Below are some of the most common types.</p><p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Major depression</strong><br>
          A person with major depression experiences a constant state of sadness. They may lose interest in activities that they used to enjoy.<br>

Treatment usually involves medication and psychotherapy.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Persistent depressive disorder</strong><br>
          Also known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder causes symptoms that last for at least 2 years.<br>

A person with this disorder may have episodes of major depression as well as milder symptoms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong><br>
          Depression is a common symptom of bipolar disorder, and research shows that people with this disorder may have symptoms around half of the time. This can make bipolar disorder hard to distinguish from depression.<br>

What does bipolar disorder involve, and what types are there? 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Psychotic depression</strong><br>
          Some people experience psychosis with depression.<br>

Psychosis can involve delusions, such as false beliefs and a detachment from reality. It can also involve hallucinations — sensing things that do not exist.
